# Clipboard
**Clipboard** is a nifty little tool that saves your last clipboard entries for later use.
If you want to give it a try head over to the [releases](https://github.com/PhilipTrauner/Clipboard/releases/tag/v1.0) section and follow the installation instructions.



**DISCLAIMER:** Code is definitely not pretty. I made this thing a long time ago and it sure looks like it.
